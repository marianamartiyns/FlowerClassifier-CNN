# ðŸŒº Flower Recognition with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

> Image classification using deep learning to recognize different types of flowers.

### > ðŸ“‹ Description

This project implements a flower recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Users can upload flower images and receive predictions about the flower type along with a confidence score.

### > ðŸ§© Features and Analytical Techniques

- [x] **Data Loading & Preprocessing**: Image dataset preparation, including resizing, augmentation, and train-validation split.
- [x] **CNN Model Training**: Deep learning architecture with convolutional, pooling, dropout, and dense layers implemented using TensorFlow/Keras.
- [x] **Image Classification**: Users can upload flower images, and the trained model predicts the flower type with confidence scores.

### > ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- **`app.py`**: Streamlit-based web application for image uploads and predictions.
- **`Flower_Classification.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the CNN model development and training.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Python dependencies required to run the project.
- **`images/`**: Dataset directory containing training and validation flower images.
- **`sample/`**: Sample images to test the application.
